            <p>
                Inspired by Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan, one of the world’s greatest-ever mathematical geniuses, 
                the College adheres to the core values of dedication, hard work and commitment as encapsulated in 
                the motto of the University of Delhi – Nistha, Dhriti and Satyam.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ramanujan College, formerly known as Deshbandhu College (Evening), was established in 1958 by 
                the Ministry of Rehabilitation, Government of India, in the memory of Late Lala Deshbandhu Gupta, 
                a patriot who had dedicated his life to the national freedom struggle. The College is 100% funded 
                by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and has been maintained by the University of Delhi since 1972. 
                The College opened its gate for women students in 1994. In 2010, the Deshbandhu College (Evening) 
                was renamed as the Ramanujan College. The College became a full-fledged day college since 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the past decade, the college has been on a path of unprecedented growth. With the introduction 
                of many new courses, and a rapidly expanding infrastructure that seeks to provide the latest facilities, 
                the college boldly looks forward to new challenges of the future.
